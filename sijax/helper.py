    into a directory of your choice.

    It may be a good idea to run this whenever Sijax gets upgraded,
    so that your files will be kept in sync.

    The directory that you provide needs to be empty (if it exists),
    or to have been previously used by this same function.
    If the provided directory contains some other files, Sijax will refuse
    to use it, by raising a :class:`sijax.exception.SijaxError` exception.

    The following files will be made available in the specified directory:

    * ``sijax.js`` - the core javascript file used by Sijax
    * ``json2.js`` - JSON library that can be loaded for browsers
                     that don't support native JSON (like IE <= 7)
    * ``sijax_comet.js`` - the javascript file used by the Comet plugin
    * ``sijax_upload.js`` - the javascript file used by the Upload plugin
    * ``sijax_version`` - a system file that keeps track of versioning -
                          do not touch this file
