    We recommend the ``args_extra`` option to be used here, so that the
    response function would receive the files object or
    anything else it might be needing to manipulate file uploads.
    By using ``args_extra`` you could change the response function's
    default signature from::

        def upload_handler(obj_response, form_values)

    to::

        def upload_handler(obj_response, files, form_values)

    where the args_extra=[files] option was passed during registering.
    To learn more on how the ``args_extra`` option works,
    refer to :meth:`sijax.Sijax.register_callback`.

    It's very important to keep in mind that unlike the regular
    :meth:`sijax.Sijax.register_callback` function, this one
    returns some javascript code as a response.
    You need to execute that code on the page that contains the
    form you want to transform to Sijax upload.

    :param sijax_instance: the :class:`sijax.Sijax` instance
                           to register callbacks with
    :param form_id: the id of the form as it appears in the DOM
    :param callback: the function to call to process the upload request
    :param options: options to pass to :meth:`sijax.Sijax.register_callback`
    :return: string - javascript code you need to put on your page,
                      to make your form use Sijax when submitted
