    sijax.response.streaming
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Provides a response class to be used when Sijax functions
    are invoked using a form submitted to an iframe,
    instead of XHR (``jQuery.ajax``).
    The main difference from the BaseResponse class is that this one
    can do streaming, meaning it can flush the commands queue back to
    the browser at any time.

    This class extends :class:`sijax.response.BaseResponse` and
    every available method from it works here too.

    This is used by plugins that use an iframe to perform the Sijax call,
    instead of doing a regular ajax request.
    This has the benefit of allowing us to do streaming, which means that
    response functions can flush the commands buffer whenever they want
    without exiting.

    To push the current commands to the browser you need to use ``yield``,
    like this::

        def my_func(obj_response):
            obj_response.alert('Doing some work.. wait a second')
            yield obj_response

            from time import sleep
            sleep(5)

            obj_response.alert('Done!')

    Your don't need to explicitly ``yield`` at the end of a streaming function.
    What remains unsent when the function exits will eventually get sent.

        Streaming functions are the typical Comet response functions,
        which are generators (they use yield to flush content).
